# Source this file to put our "python" script on the PATH.
# This python script runs python3 with environment variables set up so that we
# pick up our local libeantic(xx) libraries when testing.

# This is a hack. But note that we cannot simply put the contents of
# bin/python.in into this environment file since security measures on macOS
# sanitize DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH before following shebangs. Why DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
# is absolutely necessary to make things work on macOS is still unclear to us.
# Without it, i.e., when just telling cppyy/cling with `#pragma cling
# add_library_path` where `libeantic.dylib` and `libeanticxx.dylib` live
# locally, the libraries load but some symbols in these libraries fail to
# resolve mysteriously later.
