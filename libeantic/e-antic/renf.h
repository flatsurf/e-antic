/// Using an array of length one instead of a plain `renf` or a `renf*` is a
/// common trick in C which is probably best known from MPFR and GMP but also
/// used in the FLINT and Arb libraries that we build upon.
/// Essentially, this gives much better semantics than a plain `renf`. E.g., a
/// `renf_t` is not assignable. (Directly assigning a `renf` to another `renf`
/// does not do what one would expect as the heap-allocated parts of a `renf`
/// are not duplicated correctly.) Also, calling a function that accepts a
/// `renf_t` passes the value with reference semantics, as if it were a
/// `renf*`, i.e., without copying the underlying value. Since a `renf_t` is
/// always stack allocated and cannot be returned from a function, it is also
/// much harder to produce dangling pointers which one would get when using
/// `renf*` everywhere instead.
