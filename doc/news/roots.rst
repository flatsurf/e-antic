**Added:**

* Added `renf_class` that uses a root with dynamic precision. (Makes it easier to specify a root when the roots of the minimal polynomial are very close to each other.)

**Fixed:**

* Fixed construction of `RealEmbeddedNumberField` in Python when roots of the minimal polynomial are very close to each other.
