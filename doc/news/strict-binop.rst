**Deprecated:**

* Deprecated arithmetic between elements in different number fields in the C++ interface. Before, an operation such as `a + b` was possible even if `a` and `b` lived in different number fields if at least one of them was actually a rational number. This led to inconsistent parent fields of the resulting element. We still allow such operations if the parent of `a` or `b` is the rational field (`renf_class::make()`) otherwise a deprecation warning is printed. To fully opt in to the new behaviour set the environment variable `LIBEANTIC_STRICT_BINOP` to any value; this raises an exception instead of printing a warning.
