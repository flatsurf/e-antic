Welcome to pyeantic's documentation!
====================================

`pyeantic` is a Python interface to the `e-antic` library. If you want to
install `pyeantic`, it has to be installed together with `e-antic`. We
refer to the Installation section in the `libeantic documentation
<../libeantic>`_ for the procedure.
