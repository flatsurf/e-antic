e-antic Reference Manual
========================

Our reference manual is built from three parts:

* static `.md` Markdown files that give a high-level overview of e-antic
* documentation that is generated by
  [standardese](https://github.com/standardese/standardese) from the C/C++
  header files
* documentation that is generated by [Sphinx](https://sphinx-doc.org) from the
  pyeantic Python modules and some `.rst` files in `pyeantic/`.

Build the Reference Manual
--------------------------

Running `make html` builds the documentation. You can then run `make serve`
here to see the generated documentation on http://localhost:8080.

The underlying process is somewhat complicated by the links between the C/C++
and Python documentation. The idea is that both sides build a [Sphinx
inventory](https://sphobjinv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/syntax.html) and then use
[intersphinx
linking](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/intersphinx.html).
