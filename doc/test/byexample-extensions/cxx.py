r"""
Extend byexample with natural C(++) tests

Byexample supports C++ directly through cling. However, it expects tests to be
written cling syntax which is somewhat cryptic to readers not familiar with
cling.

Here we extend byexample with a parser that can detect regular source code in
MarkDown code fences and expected outputs in `// ->` comments.

We also extend the cling invocation to pass more parameters to cling through
the `EXTRA_CLING_ARGS` environment variable.
