        In particular, this is the directory passed with --build-base.

        to make sure that this happens to be build/ relative to the current
        working directory during the install phase since otherwise the install
        step won't be able to find the assets that have been built by the build

        trying to build a wheel.

        invoking `pip install` since that tries to build a wheel first. You
