# On macOS we cannot run `sage -tp` directly to run tests since that's a shell
# script and macOS will sanitize our DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH then. So we need to
# invoke the Python script `sage-runtests` with our `bin/python` script that
# sets up that variable properly.

# `sage-runtests` assumes that `sage-env-config` and `sage-env` have been
# sourced by the `sage` script already. However, not all systems (ArchLinux)
# ship `sage-env` and `sage-env-config`. So instead, we start sage directly,
# record the set environment variables and set them locally. This is a hack,
# but we could not find any better way to work around the paranoic measures in
# macOS.
